## 🔍 About Me

I'm an aspiring engineer with a passion for building solutions that intersect **technology and real-world impact**. From image colorization with deep learning to biomedical imaging using holography, I love exploring diverse domains through **self-driven projects** and **research internships**.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me organizing events, moderating communities, or simply jamming with my guitar 🎸.
